  "context": "In 2005, SPS Commerce launched the Retail Network, establishing its cloud-based trading partner community. The EDI market was dominated by traditional VAN (Value-Added Network) providers like Sterling Commerce, GXS, and Inovis. These companies were evolving from pure VAN services to 'integration service providers' offering software, services, and hosting. The EDI industry was experiencing 5-20% annual revenue declines as the market matured and consolidated.",
