The company had regained its position above RedPrairie. The WMS market grew nearly 10% in 2010 from $1 billion to $1.1 billion. SAP and Oracle dominated with combined revenue exceeding $2.5 billion, while Manhattan was establishing itself with a platform approach to supply chain that analysts viewed favorably. JDA Software's acquisition of i2 Technologies in early 2010 was the most noteworthy industry event. Manhattan was recognized for being on the right path with its unified platform strategy.",
