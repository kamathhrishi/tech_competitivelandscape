  "context": "By 2020, GoDaddy was the world's fifth largest web host by market share with over 62 million registered domains. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated digital transformation, driving strong growth in website builders. Wix experienced exceptional growth in 2020, adding 31 million users to reach 200 million total users and gaining 1 million paid subscribers. The website builder market leaders were Wix (45% market share), Squarespace (16%), and GoDaddy's GoCentral (10%). Competition intensified in the website builder space as no-code tools became mainstream. Common complaints about GoDaddy included renewal pricing increases and extra fees for basic features like email, SSL, backups, and privacy protection that competitors were including for free.",
