  "context": "In 2020, Dynatrace competed in the APM and observability market that saw rapid growth due to cloud-native adoption and microservices. The pandemic accelerated digital transformation and observability needs. Datadog was a fast-growing competitor with cloud-native architecture. New Relic shifted to consumption-based pricing. The market was transitioning from traditional APM to full-stack observability including logs, metrics, and traces. Dynatrace's AI-powered automation (Davis AI) was a key differentiator.",
