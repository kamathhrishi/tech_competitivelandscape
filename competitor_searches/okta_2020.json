  "context": "In 2020, Okta continued its leadership in cloud-based identity management. Microsoft Azure AD was the primary competitor due to Microsoft 365 integration. The year saw increased demand for identity solutions as remote work expanded. Okta announced its acquisition of Auth0 (completed 2021) for $6.5B, eliminating a key developer-focused competitor and strengthening its position in the identity market.",
