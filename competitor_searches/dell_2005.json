  "context": "In 2005, Dell's sales growth slowed considerably despite continued earnings growth, with the stock losing 25% of its value. By Q4 2006, Dell lost its title as largest PC manufacturer to HP, whose restructuring under CEO Mark Hurd reinvigorated its Personal Systems Group. The slowing growth was attributed to the maturing PC market, which constituted 66% of Dell's sales. 2006 marked the first year Dell's growth was slower than the PC industry as a whole.",
