  "context": "DocuSign dominates the e-signature market with over 70% market share in 2024. However, G2 counts at least 350 DocuSign competitors, with 100 having four-star ratings or better. Users commonly seek alternatives due to DocuSign's complex interface, lack of free plan, and limited monthly signature requests on lower tiers. DocuSign's Personal plan costs $120 annually but limits users to 5 signature requests per month. Many alternatives offer better usage limits, competitive pricing, and advanced features as standard, with some providing unlimited signatures for free.",
