  "context": "The Trade Desk was founded in November 2009 by Jeff Green and Dave Pickles, veterans from Microsoft's AdECN acquisition. In 2010, the company raised $2.5 million in venture capital to advance its self-service, cloud-based demand-side platform (DSP). The programmatic advertising industry was in its infancy, with real-time bidding (RTB) representing only 2% of display ad spend. DSPs were just emerging as a technology category around 2011, following the launch of ad exchanges in 2007. The Trade Desk differentiated itself through its purely buy-side focus and commitment to transparency in the fragmented and opaque digital advertising landscape.",
