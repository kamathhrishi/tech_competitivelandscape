  "context": "In 2024, GitLab competes as an all-in-one DevOps platform against GitHub's community-focused approach. GitLab takes a slight lead in CI/CD with built-in, highly integrated CI/CD environment catering to the DevOps lifecycle, allowing multi-step testing, deployment, and monitoring without third-party integrations. Many teams prefer a modular stack (e.g., Gitea + Buildkite + SonarQube + Argo CD) for flexibility. The choice between GitHub and GitLab often comes down to specific needs: GitLab for all-in-one DevOps, GitHub for community and collaboration. Self-hosted alternatives like Gitea are popular for organizations wanting full control.",
