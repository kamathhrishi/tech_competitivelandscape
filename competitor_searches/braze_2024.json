  "context": "In 2024, Braze faces intense competition in a mature and crowded customer engagement platform market. The competitive landscape is characterized by specialized players (CleverTap, OneSignal) competing alongside enterprise giants (Salesforce, Adobe). Key competitive factors include AI-driven personalization, real-time data processing, omnichannel capabilities, and pricing. Braze's main challenges include high subscription costs (ranging from $43,400 to $72,400 annually for organizations with ~200 employees) and interface complexity, which drive customers toward more accessible alternatives.",
