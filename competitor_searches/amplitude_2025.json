  "context": "Amplitude is a product analytics platform with user sentiment rating of 90 based on 2,735 reviews. In 2025, companies face challenges with Amplitude's steep learning curve, pricing based on Monthly Tracked Users (MTUs) making costs unpredictable as usage scales, lack of user engagement layer, and absence of automated event tracking.
