Google dominates search with 89.66-90.7% global market share, while Google Cloud holds 13% market share chasing Amazon and Microsoft.

Heavy reliance on advertising revenue (63.8% of global social media ad spend in H1 2024) coupled with regulatory pressures presents ongoing challenges. Integration with Android ecosystem (3+ billion devices) provides a strong competitive moat.",
