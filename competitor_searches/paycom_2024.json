  "context": "In 2024, Paycom competes in the mid-market payroll and HR space with limited integrations compared to competitors - notably doesn't connect with QuickBooks. Users commonly complain about implementation issues, time clock and PTO errors, technical glitches, and slow customer support response times. Paylocity is the most similar competitor targeting larger businesses, while Gusto serves small/midsize businesses with more integrations and transparent pricing. ADP and Workday target enterprises with global capabilities. The market has shifted toward integrated HR, IT, and finance platforms like Rippling.",
