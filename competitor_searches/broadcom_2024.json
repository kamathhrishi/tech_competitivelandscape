  "context": "In 2024, Broadcom completed its monumental $61-69 billion acquisition of VMware (late 2023), becoming a true hybrid infrastructure giant. The company surpassed $1 trillion market cap in December 2024, becoming the 12th company to achieve this milestone. Broadcom's business is split between semiconductors (58% of revenue) and infrastructure software (42%). In semiconductors, the company dominates networking chips, custom AI ASICs (co-developed Google's TPU), and wireless solutions. In software, the VMware acquisition created one of the largest infrastructure software portfolios alongside CA Technologies and Symantec. Major challenges include VMware customer migration to subscription pricing and competition from alternative virtualization platforms.",
