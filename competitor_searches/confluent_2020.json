Amazon MSK emerged as a significant competitor offering managed Kafka on AWS. The pandemic accelerated real-time data streaming adoption for digital transformation. Apache Pulsar gained attention as an alternative architecture. Cloud providers increasingly offered managed streaming services, creating both competition and partnership opportunities.
