  "context": "Samsara was founded in 2015 by Sanjit Biswas and John Bicket, former co-founders of Meraki (sold to Cisco in 2012). The company launched with a vision to provide sensor technology for industrial operations, backed by Andreessen Horowitz in its Series A round. As a new entrant in 2015, Samsara entered a market already dominated by established fleet telematics and industrial IoT providers. The company's first product was the Vehicle Gateway, designed for real-time fleet operations. At this early stage, Samsara faced competition from well-established players like Geotab (founded 2000), Verizon Connect, FleetUp, and Lytx, all of which had significant market presence and mature product offerings in the telematics space.",
