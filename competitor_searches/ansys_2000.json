  "context": "In 2000, ANSYS was an established structural analysis software company that had gone public in 1996. The simulation market was fragmented with specialized vendors in structural (ANSYS, MSC, ABAQUS), CFD (Fluent, CFX), and other domains. ANSYS competed primarily in structural analysis against MSC Nastran. The dot-com boom was driving engineering software demand. Major consolidation would come later with ANSYS acquiring CFX (2003) and Fluent (2006).",
