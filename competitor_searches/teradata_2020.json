The pandemic accelerated cloud data warehouse adoption. Teradata responded with Vantage, its cloud-enabled analytics platform available on AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. Competition shifted from on-premises to multi-cloud deployment models. The data lakehouse concept from Databricks represented new architectural competition.",
