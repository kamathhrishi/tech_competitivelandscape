  "context": "In 2010, Zuora was still in its early growth phase, having just raised $20 million in Series C funding. The subscription billing market was nascent, with most competition coming from traditional ERP vendors (Oracle, SAP, NetSuite) that offered billing modules as part of broader enterprise systems. Purpose-built subscription billing platforms were rare. Zuora was founded in 2007 by former WebEx engineers and a Salesforce executive, positioning itself as a pioneer in cloud-based subscription management.",
