  "context": "In 2010, when Domo was founded, the BI market was dominated by traditional enterprise solutions like IBM Cognos, SAP BusinessObjects, Oracle BI, and MicroStrategy. Tableau (founded 2003) was emerging as a leader in data visualization. The market was on the cusp of cloud transformation. Microsoft Power BI did not yet exist (launched 2011). Domo entered as an early cloud-native BI platform in a market still dominated by on-premise solutions.",
