  "context": "By 2020, the CPaaS market was mature and highly competitive. Twilio faced pressure on pricing from competitors like Plivo offering 30-40% lower costs. The market evolved toward omnichannel communications (SMS, voice, WhatsApp, email) rather than single-channel solutions. Key differentiators included global carrier coverage, pricing, call quality, and ease of integration. SMBs and startups increasingly sought alternatives due to Twilio's higher costs and lack of free support. COVID-19 pandemic accelerated digital communications adoption.",
