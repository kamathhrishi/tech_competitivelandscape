  "context": "In 2024, The Trade Desk maintained its position as the premier independent demand-side platform globally, holding a commanding 25.8% of the programmatic advertising DSP market in 2023. The company announced revenue of $2.44 billion in 2024, a 26% increase from the previous year, with $12.04 billion in advertising spend flowing through its platform. The Trade Desk is recognized as a power user's DSP, offering transparency, customizability, and control across display, video, audio, and CTV channels. The competitive landscape is defined by the tension between walled gardens (Google, Amazon, Meta) that own content and control data versus independent platforms like The Trade Desk that emphasize neutrality and transparency. AI-powered optimization and cookieless advertising solutions became critical differentiators as the industry adapted to privacy changes and moved away from third-party cookies.",
