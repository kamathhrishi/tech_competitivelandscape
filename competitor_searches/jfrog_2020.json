  "context": "By 2020, the DevOps artifact repository market had matured significantly with the rise of containerization and cloud-native development. Major cloud providers (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) had launched competing artifact registry services deeply integrated with their platforms. GitHub and GitLab expanded beyond source control to offer integrated package management. The market shifted from primarily Java-focused Maven repositories to supporting diverse package formats (Docker, npm, NuGet, PyPI, etc.). Container registries became critical infrastructure.",
