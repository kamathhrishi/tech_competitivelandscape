  "context": "For the fifth year in a row, SentinelOne has been named a Leader in the 2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Endpoint Protection Platforms. CrowdStrike Falcon is considered the best overall alternative with superior threat intelligence, though at a higher price point suitable for large enterprises. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint offers strong Windows ecosystem integration. A common criticism of SentinelOne is its complex user interface with a steep learning curve, making it less intuitive than some competitors. The market includes enterprise-focused solutions (CrowdStrike, Palo Alto) and SMB-friendly options (Sophos).",
