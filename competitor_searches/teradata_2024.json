  "context": "In 2024, Teradata faces intense competition from cloud-native data platforms, particularly Snowflake and Databricks which have disrupted traditional data warehousing with consumption-based pricing and lakehouse architectures. Cloud hyperscalers (AWS Redshift, Google BigQuery, Azure Synapse) offer integrated analytics within their ecosystems. Teradata has responded with Vantage, its cloud-native analytics platform, to compete in multi-cloud environments. The market shift toward cloud, real-time analytics, and AI/ML integration has challenged traditional on-premises data warehouse vendors. Legacy enterprise vendors (Oracle, IBM, SAP) also compete for existing enterprise customers.",
