  "context": "In 2024, Confluent IPO'd at over $11B valuation but trades near $6.5B after growing revenues slightly over 25% YoY, approaching $1B in revenues. Major consolidation wave in event streaming with WarpStream acquired by Confluent for $220M. Redpanda valued at $500M+ with 300% revenue growth. Some analysts suggest limited remaining opportunity in real-time event streaming. Snowflake and Databricks haven't entered the space but likely will. Confluent responded with TableFlow (Kafka to Iceberg, March 2024), Freight Clusters with decoupled storage-compute (May 2024, 90% networking cost reduction), and the Kora engine (up to 16x faster than traditional Kafka).",
