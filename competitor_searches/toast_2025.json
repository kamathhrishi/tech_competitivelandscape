  "context": "As of 2025, Toast is an established public company and leading cloud-based restaurant management software platform based in Boston, Massachusetts. The company serves approximately 120,000 US restaurants (as of June 2024) with an all-in-one Android-based POS system. Toast maintains 21.72% market share in the POS systems category, competing against 219 competitor tools. Square remains the market leader with 25.56% share. The restaurant technology market remains highly fragmented with significant opportunity for growth, as Toast still serves less than 15% of the 800,000+ US restaurant locations. The competitive landscape features a mix of general-purpose POS systems, restaurant-specific solutions, and specialized providers targeting different restaurant segments.",
