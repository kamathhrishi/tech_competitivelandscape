  "context": "By 2024, Amplitude had established itself as a leading product analytics platform with 10,678 of the top 1 million websites using it. The competitive landscape had become highly fragmented with specialized tools emerging in different niches. Key competitive trends include: (1) warehouse-native architectures (Kubit, Optimizely) offering lower cost and better data security, (2) all-in-one platforms combining analytics with session replay, feature flags, and A/B testing (PostHog, Pendo), (3) autocapture capabilities to reduce manual tracking burden (Heap). Amplitude's pricing had increased to around $25,000/year for entry plans.",
