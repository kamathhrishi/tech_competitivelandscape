  "context": "Domo is a business intelligence and analytics platform with 0.60% market share competing against 189 tools in the BI category. In 2025, companies seek alternatives due to cryptic pricing (no public rates, personalized quotes, $2,000-$4,000/month for small teams, $10,000+/month for larger teams) and performance issues (slow data fetches especially with big datasets). Platforms like Luzmo and ThoughtSpot offer faster deployment, clearer pricing, and modern AI capabilities.",
