  "context": "The 2025 data security market shows Varonis competitors taking the lead, with Osano holding a dominant 37.54% market share compared to Varonis DatAdvantage's 0.02% slice. Organizations explore Varonis alternatives due to pricing complexity, usability concerns, limited integrations, and resource-heavy deployment requirements. Varonis's pricing structure frustrates organizations with lack of transparency and high costs - company doesn't show base prices on website. SMBs often receive quotes around $150,000 that drop to $100,000 after negotiations. Teams now shortlist competitors offering agentless coverage, instant SaaS integrations, GenAI awareness, and automated remediation. Deciding factors are breadth of integrations, signal quality in real workflows, time to value, and whether remediation is first class or afterthought. Varonis originally built platform on agent-based model and expanded into cloud and SaaS security; historically recognized for strength in discovering and classifying on-premises data, but customer feedback notes cloud-native capabilities still maturing and remediation features limited compared to competitors.",
