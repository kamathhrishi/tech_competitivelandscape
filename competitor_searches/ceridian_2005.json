  "context": "In 2005, Ceridian was operating as a traditional payroll services and HR outsourcing company following its 2001 restructuring. The HCM market was dominated by on-premise software solutions and service bureau models. ADP and Paychex led the payroll services market, while Oracle's acquisition of PeopleSoft in January 2005 consolidated the enterprise HCM software market. Cloud-based HCM solutions were just emerging with Workday's founding in 2005. Ceridian competed in payroll processing, benefits administration, and HR outsourcing services.",
