  "context": "In 2015, Paycom had recently gone public (April 2014 IPO) and was growing in the mid-market cloud HCM space. ADP and Paychex dominated payroll services. Ultimate Software was a key cloud HCM competitor before its 2020 merger with Kronos. The HCM market was shifting to cloud-based, single-database solutions. Paycom's employee self-service and single application approach were key differentiators against traditional payroll bureaus.",
