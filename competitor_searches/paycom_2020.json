  "context": "In 2020, Paycom competed in the mid-market HCM space against larger players ADP and Paychex and similar-sized Paylocity. The major industry event was the merger of Ultimate Software and Kronos to form UKG in April 2020, creating a major competitor. The pandemic shifted focus to remote workforce management and digital HR processes, benefiting cloud-native HCM providers. Paycom's single-database architecture and employee self-service were key differentiators.",
