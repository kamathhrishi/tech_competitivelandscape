  "context": "In 2024, Elastic faces competition following its license change from Apache 2 to proprietary dual license, prompting the OpenSearch fork. The ELK stack is hard to manage at scale and becomes unstable when pushed beyond architectural limits. While ELK software is free, setup requires infrastructure and training, with ongoing data retention costs making ownership expensive. SigNoz has emerged as a significantly faster open-source alternative using ClickHouse. Splunk and Datadog represent commercial alternatives with broader observability platforms. Organizations seek alternatives due to management complexity, licensing concerns, and escalating data retention costs.",
