  "context": "In 2010, the DevOps and artifact repository management space was still emerging. JFrog was founded in 2008 and Artifactory was in its early stages. The competitive landscape was dominated by open-source solutions, particularly in the Java ecosystem. Sonatype Nexus (launched around 2008) was the primary commercial competitor. Cloud-native DevOps tools and container registries had not yet emerged. The market was primarily focused on Maven repository management for Java artifacts, with limited support for other package formats.",
