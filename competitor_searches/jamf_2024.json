  "context": "The 2024 MDM landscape is highly competitive and segmented into Apple-focused versus cross-platform solutions. Jamf remains the dominant Apple-only MDM provider with 70,000+ companies after 20+ years, but faces increasing competition from newer Apple-focused entrants like Kandji (2018) offering simpler configuration and automation. Cross-platform competitors like Microsoft Intune dominate overall endpoint management with ~95% market share by supporting all major OS platforms. Organizations seek alternatives to Jamf due to higher pricing, complexity requiring specialized training, and Apple-only focus creating challenges for mixed device environments. The market has matured with 72% of employees choosing Mac over PC in employee-choice programs, driving enterprise adoption.",
