  "context": "In 2024, Sprout Social is positioned as one of the more expensive social media management tools with per-seat pricing starting at $199/user/month. The competitive landscape has intensified with platforms differentiating on pricing models (per-seat vs. flat-rate), target markets (SMB vs. enterprise), and feature specialization (visual-first, collaboration-focused, analytics-driven). Key competitive pressure comes from more affordable alternatives like Hootsuite, Agorapulse, and Later, as well as enterprise-focused platforms like Sprinklr.",
