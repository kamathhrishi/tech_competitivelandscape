  "context": "In 2024, Veeva Systems maintains an estimated 80% global market share in the pharmaceutical CRM market and serves over 1,400 customers including a majority of top biopharmaceutical companies. Fiscal year 2025 revenues reached $2,746.6 million, a 16% increase YoY. The top 10 life sciences software vendors are IQVIA (16.3% share), Microsoft, Veeva Systems, Salesforce, Dassault Systèmes, SAP, Oracle, Revvity, ServiceNow, and Clario. Veeva's key advantage is that competitors are not as focused on life sciences: Medidata was acquired by engineering software company Dassault, Oracle serves many industries, and IQVIA is not primarily known as a software developer.",
