  "context": "As of 2025, the website builder market remains highly competitive and segmented by use case. Wix continues as a leading all-around solution for small businesses and individuals, but faces intense pressure from specialized competitors. Squarespace is positioned as the best overall alternative with superior templates and value pricing. Shopify dominates e-commerce with over 4 million websites. Webflow's popularity has grown among professionals and agencies seeking advanced customization. Key competitive factors include: ease of use, template quality, e-commerce capabilities, SEO tools, performance/load speed, and pricing. Wix's weaknesses include slower load times, template lock-in, limited scalability, and less sophisticated e-commerce compared to specialists.",

    {
      "name": "Squarespace",
      "notes": "Research shows Squarespace is the best Wix alternative overall in 2025. Biggest direct competitor with unparalleled template design quality and easy-to-use editor. Ideal for service-based businesses with integrated Acuity Scheduling. Better value with pricing $16-$99/month vs Wix's $17-$159/month - top Squarespace plan costs one-third of Wix's most expensive plan. Some add-ons cheaper than Wix equivalents."
    },
    {
      "name": "Shopify",
      "notes": "Premier e-commerce competitor powering over 4 million websites globally. Built specifically for online selling with comprehensive features far exceeding Wix's e-commerce capabilities. Hands-down best alternative for users focused on creating online stores. Superior inventory management, multi-channel coordination, and 6,000+ specialized e-commerce apps. Plans from $35/month."
    },
    {
      "name": "Webflow",
      "notes": "Leading professional website builder with growing popularity among businesses, agencies, and creators. Visual web design platform combining design flexibility, built-in CMS, and fast hosting in one package. Better than Wix for professional design needs, offering more control than traditional drag-and-drop builders. Superior for SEO and performance with clean code output and advanced optimization. Allows code export for easy migration unlike Wix's platform lock-in."
    },
    {
      "name": "WordPress",
      "notes": "Most flexible and powerful alternative to Wix as open-source CMS powering every fourth website globally. WordPress.org offers unmatched customization with thousands of themes, 59,000+ plugins, and complete website control. Professionals worldwide contribute daily. More powerful for designers, developers, and anyone needing 100% customized projects that can scale over years. Requires more technical knowledge than Wix but offers far greater long-term flexibility."
    },
    {
      "name": "Hostinger Website Builder",
      "notes": "Best budget-friendly alternative starting at $2.99/month (1-4 year commitment) - among cheapest website builders available. Sites performed best in load speed testing on both mobile and desktop, significantly beating Wix. Easier drag-and-drop editor with fewer complex options. Offers e-commerce on all plans while Wix restricts to specific packages. Trade-off: lacks Wix's extensive app store and advanced blogging features."
    },
    {
      "name": "GoDaddy Website Builder",
      "notes": "One of Wix's biggest competitors as all-in-one builder with generous free plan, 100+ templates, and complete e-commerce and marketing feature set. Code-free platform that helps set up powerful online stores and scale with ease. Leverages strong brand and existing customer relationships from domain/hosting business."
    },
    {
      "name": "Weebly",
      "notes": "Square-owned platform considered best for average users wanting better e-commerce functionality and more apps than basic Wix. Allows free selling capability. Mobile app enables site creation on-the-go. However, platform hasn't received regular updates since 2019, making it dated compared to actively developed competitors."
    },
    {
      "name": "Duda",
      "notes": "Specialized website builder for agencies and freelancers managing multiple client projects. One of rare platforms offering true multilingual capabilities with unique management system.

    },
    {
      "name": "Pixpa",
      "notes": "Visual-first platform for creative professionals, artists, and content creators. Primarily used for professional portfolios but also supports online stores.
