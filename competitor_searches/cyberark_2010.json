  "context": "By 2010, CyberArk had established itself as a leader in the growing Privileged Access Management market, having opened its U.S. headquarters in 2004 and continued to develop its Privileged Account Security Solution. The PAM market was maturing beyond basic password vaults, with organizations recognizing the critical need to secure privileged accounts against insider threats and external attacks. CyberArk competed in an evolving landscape where traditional identity management vendors were adding PAM capabilities to their portfolios, while specialized PAM vendors were gaining traction. The market began to shift from manual, spreadsheet-based approaches to automated, policy-based privileged access control with session monitoring and auditing capabilities.",
