  "context": "Varonis Systems was founded in 2005 by Yaki Faitelson and Ohad Korkus, former employees of NetVision and NetApp. By 2010, the company was establishing itself in the emerging data security governance market with its platform for managing unstructured data and protecting against insider threats. The market for specialized data governance was still nascent, with most competition coming from traditional security vendors and storage companies that included basic access control features. Varonis focused on metadata analysis and data access governance for file systems and unstructured data.",
