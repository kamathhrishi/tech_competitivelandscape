  "context": "2015 marked a pivotal year for CyberArk as the company had successfully gone public on NASDAQ in 2014 under the ticker CYBR, demonstrating the maturity of the PAM market. The company had grown from $66.2 million in 2013 revenue to become a recognized leader in privileged access management. The PAM market was experiencing rapid growth as high-profile breaches highlighted the critical importance of securing privileged accounts. Gartner began publishing Magic Quadrants for PAM, establishing evaluation criteria around privileged account and session management (PASM), privilege elevation and delegation management (PEDM), and secrets management. CyberArk competed in an increasingly sophisticated market where vendors differentiated on all-in-one platforms versus best-of-breed solutions.",
