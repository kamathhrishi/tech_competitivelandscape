  "context": "By 2005, Fair Isaac Corporation had expanded significantly beyond credit scoring. In 2002, the company completed a merger with HNC Software Inc. (valued at approximately $238 million), integrating neural network-based fraud management systems into its portfolio and strengthening its predictive analytics offerings. In September 2005, FICO acquired certain assets of RulesPower Inc. to advance its Blaze Advisor platform for handling complex business rules and decision processes. The company officially changed its name from Fair, Isaac and Company to Fair Isaac Corporation in 2003. Competition was intensifying as the credit bureaus began exploring ways to reduce dependence on FICO.",
