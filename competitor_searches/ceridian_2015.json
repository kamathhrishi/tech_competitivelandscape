  "context": "By 2015, Ceridian had fully acquired and integrated Dayforce (acquired 2012) and was positioning itself as a cloud-based HCM leader. The company completed the separation of its HCM and payments businesses in 2013. The HCM market had shifted decisively toward cloud solutions, with Workday leading the charge in enterprise HCM and newer players like Paycom and Paylocity gaining market share. Ceridian's Dayforce platform competed with its unified cloud architecture combining HR, payroll, benefits, workforce management, and talent in a single application.",
