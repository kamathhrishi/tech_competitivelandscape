  "context": "Okta has a market share of 41.73% in the identity and access management market, competing with 26 competitor tools in the category. Around the world in 2025, over 27,605 companies use Okta as an IAM tool. However, organizations increasingly seek alternatives due to complex setup requiring specialized IT expertise, some actions that cannot be carried out in bulk, expensive pricing (particularly for smaller businesses), and challenges in justifying ongoing spend. With 80% of breaches linked to compromised identities, organizations need IAM solutions with seamless access control and resilient user verification. The 2025 IAM market emphasizes modular pricing, pay-as-you-grow flexibility, and solutions that provide complete visibility and control.",
