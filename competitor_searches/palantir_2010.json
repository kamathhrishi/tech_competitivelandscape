  "context": "In 2010, Palantir was a secretive startup focused primarily on government and intelligence community clients. The company's Gotham platform was used by CIA, NSA, and military intelligence. Competition came from defense contractors and specialized analytics vendors like i2 (acquired by IBM 2011). Palantir differentiated with user-friendly data integration and analysis for analysts. Commercial expansion was limited; the focus was government contracts worth hundreds of millions.",
