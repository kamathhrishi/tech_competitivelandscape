  "context": "In 2020, Elastic competed with its ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) against Splunk and cloud-native alternatives. AWS's launch of Open Distro for Elasticsearch created tension over open-source licensing. The observability market was consolidating around unified platforms combining logs, metrics, and APM. Elastic expanded beyond search into observability and security (SIEM). Cloud deployment through Elastic Cloud became increasingly important as customers sought managed services.",
