  "context": "In 2024, Dynatrace competes in the APM and observability market against a mix of pure-play observability vendors (Datadog, New Relic) and enterprise software companies (Splunk/Cisco, AppDynamics/Cisco). The market has seen significant consolidation with Cisco's acquisition of Splunk for $28B in 2023. Open-source alternatives like Grafana Labs continue to gain traction. Cloud-native monitoring from hyperscalers (AWS, Azure, GCP) provides competition for cloud-hosted workloads. Dynatrace differentiates with AI-powered automation and full-stack observability across hybrid and multi-cloud environments.",
