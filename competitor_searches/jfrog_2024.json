The competitive landscape has evolved beyond simple artifact storage to encompass comprehensive DevOps platforms (GitLab, GitHub, Azure DevOps) offering end-to-end solutions from source control to deployment. Security has become paramount, with dedicated software supply chain security vendors (Sonatype, Snyk) emphasizing vulnerability scanning and open source risk management. Cloud providers continue offering deeply integrated, fully-managed artifact services. The market now emphasizes AI/ML package management, container security, infrastructure-as-code scanning, and complete DevSecOps workflows.",
