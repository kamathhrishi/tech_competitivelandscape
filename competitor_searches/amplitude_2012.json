  "context": "Amplitude was founded in 2012 by Spenser Skates and Curtis Liu after discovering a gap in the market—no existing tools at the time were available to help make sense of how users interacted with their apps. The company remained in stealth mode until 2014. At the time of founding, the analytics landscape was dominated by web analytics tools like Google Analytics and early product analytics platforms like Mixpanel (founded 2009). The market for mobile and product analytics was still emerging in 2012.",
