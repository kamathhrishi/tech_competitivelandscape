  "context": "In 2010, FICO maintained its dominance in credit scoring with approximately 90% market share among top U.S. lenders, but faced new competition from VantageScore, which the three major credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian, TransUnion) had launched in 2006 as a direct alternative. FICO had sued VantageScore in 2007 but dropped the lawsuit after the court ruled in VantageScore's favor. The company continued to expand its software business beyond credit scoring into analytics and decision management, competing against major technology companies like SAS Institute, IBM, Oracle, and Pega in the broader business analytics and decision management software market.",
