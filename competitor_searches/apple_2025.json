  "context": "As of December 2025, Apple faces intensifying competition across all product lines. In China (Apple's third-largest market at $67B of $391B total FY2024 revenue), Q1 FY2025 revenue fell 11% YoY to $18.5B due to Huawei resurgence and Chinese patriotism. Globally, Android captures 70.24% mobile OS market share vs Apple's 29.04%. Apple differentiates through premium design, ecosystem integration, and brand loyalty but trails competitors in AI development. Microsoft's OpenAI investments and Copilot launch give it an AI advantage over Apple.",
