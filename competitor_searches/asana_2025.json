  "context": "In 2025, the work management and project management software market is highly competitive and mature, with AI-driven features becoming table stakes. Asana faces criticism for lacking advanced capabilities such as timesheets, workload charts, resource tracking reports, critical path analysis, and work breakdown structures - features that are essential for professional project managers. The platform's inability to assign tasks to multiple team members remains a significant limitation affecting collaboration. Organizations increasingly seek alternatives that offer greater customization, AI automation, multiple simultaneous project views, and more sophisticated resource management. Competition has intensified from both established enterprise platforms and innovative challengers offering better value propositions, more flexible workflows, and advanced analytics capabilities.",
