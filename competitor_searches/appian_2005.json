  "context": "In 2005, Appian was a young, self-funded company focused on Business Process Management (BPM) software. Founded in 1999, Appian was still in its early growth phase, competing in the nascent BPM market. The company had achieved profitability and was building its reputation as a pure-play BPM vendor. The BPM software market in 2005 was fragmented with numerous vendors competing for market share. Many of today's major low-code platforms either did not exist or were just emerging during this period.",
