  "context": "In 2024, GoDaddy remained a major player but faced intensified competition across all segments. As of 2018 data, GoDaddy was the leading registrar with 24% of worldwide domain registrations. By 2023, GoDaddy was the world's fifth largest web host by market share with over 62 million registered domains. A significant development in 2024 was GoDaddy discontinuing its dedicated web hosting services, moving all future websites to VPS hosting. The website builder market was projected to grow at 6.9% CAGR to exceed $14.4 billion globally by 2032. Customers continued to cite renewal pricing increases and extra fees for basic features as key reasons to switch from GoDaddy. Competitors increasingly included SSL, privacy protection, email, and backups for free in their entry-level plans.",
