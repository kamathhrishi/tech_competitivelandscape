  "context": "In 2024, Okta remains a leader in identity and access management (IAM) but faces significant competition from Microsoft Entra ID due to its integration with the Microsoft ecosystem. Organizations commonly seek alternatives due to Okta's prohibitive pricing (especially for small businesses), complex initial setup requiring dedicated teams or consultants, and closed architecture that limits developer customization. The market is diverse with enterprise-level competitors (Microsoft, Ping, CyberArk), mid-market alternatives (OneLogin, JumpCloud), and developer-focused solutions (Auth0, SuperTokens).",
