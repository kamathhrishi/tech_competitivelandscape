  "context": "In 2005, CyberArk was an early pioneer in the emerging Privileged Access Management (PAM) market, having been founded in 1999 by Udi Mokady and Alon N. Cohen in Israel. The company launched its Privileged Account Security Solution in 2005, built on its innovative 'Digital Vault' technology. At this time, the PAM market was still nascent, with most organizations relying on manual processes, spreadsheets, or basic password vaults to manage privileged access. CyberArk's focus on securing IT administrators' unlimited access to critical data positioned it as one of the first dedicated vendors in this space, competing primarily against general identity management solutions from established enterprise vendors.",
