  "context": "In 2024, Wix reported 258 million users across 190 countries, making it the third most popular website building solution after WordPress (63.7%) and Shopify (5.7%). The market had become highly competitive with clear differentiation: general-purpose builders (Wix, Squarespace), e-commerce specialists (Shopify, BigCommerce), and professional design platforms (Webflow). Wix faced criticism for template lock-in, scalability issues, and limited e-commerce capabilities compared to specialized competitors. Budget-friendly alternatives like Hostinger gained traction with faster performance and lower pricing.",
