COVID-19 accelerated digital transformation in life sciences, benefiting Veeva's cloud-based solutions. Veeva announced plans to migrate off Salesforce platform to its own Veeva CRM by 2025. Dassault's 2019 acquisition of Medidata created a stronger clinical trial competitor. IQVIA remained the primary competitor in life sciences data and technology.",
