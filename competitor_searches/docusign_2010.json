  "context": "In 2010, DocuSign was an emerging e-signature company growing rapidly. The e-signature market was nascent with enterprises just beginning to adopt digital signatures. Adobe EchoSign (later Adobe Sign) was a competitor. The ESIGN Act (2000) and UETA provided legal foundation for e-signatures. DocuSign focused on transaction management platform beyond simple signatures. The market was small but growing as paperless processes gained acceptance.",
