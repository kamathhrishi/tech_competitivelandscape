  "context": "In 2000, Fair Isaac Corporation (renamed from Fair, Isaac and Company in 2003) was solidifying its position in the credit scoring market. The FICO Score, created in 1989, had become increasingly important after receiving critical endorsement from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 1995 as the uniform model for mortgage underwriting. At this time, FICO competed primarily with in-house credit scoring models developed by large banks and with the three major credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion) who were both partners and competitors, as they controlled the credit data feeding into FICO's algorithms.",
