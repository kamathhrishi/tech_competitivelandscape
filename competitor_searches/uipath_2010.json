  "context": "In 2010, UiPath operated as DeskOver, a small Romanian software company founded in 2005 focused on computer vision and developer tools. The RPA market barely existed as a category. Blue Prism coined the term 'robotic process automation' and was focused on UK banking sector. UiPath had not yet pivoted to RPA platform. Desktop automation existed through tools from Nice, OpenSpan, and BPM vendors but enterprise RPA as later defined was not yet mainstream.",
