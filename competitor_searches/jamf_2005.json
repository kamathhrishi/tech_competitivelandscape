  "context": "In 2005, the Mac enterprise management market was in its early stages. Jamf (founded 2002) was one of the pioneering commercial solutions. The landscape was dominated by Apple's own basic server tools and open-source solutions. Enterprise Mac adoption was still relatively low, with corporate IT routinely ignoring Mac devices. Most management was done through Apple's Server Admin Tools, NetInstall for imaging, and free tools like DeployStudio. The iPhone hadn't launched yet (2007), so mobile device management (MDM) as we know it today didn't exist. Management focused primarily on Mac desktop/laptop deployment and imaging.",
