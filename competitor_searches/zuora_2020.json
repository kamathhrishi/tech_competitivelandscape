  "context": "By 2020, the subscription billing market had matured significantly. Zuora faced competition from both established enterprise vendors (Oracle, SAP, Salesforce) and a growing ecosystem of specialized subscription billing platforms (Chargebee, Recurly, Maxio). Companies were seeking alternatives due to Zuora's slow setup times, high costs, steep learning curve, and complex dashboard. The September 2020 acquisition of 2Checkout by Verifone reflected consolidation trends in the payment and billing space.",
