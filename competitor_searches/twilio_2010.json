  "context": "In 2010, Twilio was still a very new entrant (founded 2008) in the emerging cloud communications API market. The CPaaS (Communications Platform as a Service) market was nascent. Most competitors were traditional telecom carriers without developer-friendly APIs. Few direct API competitors existed at this time - Twilio was pioneering the developer-first communications API model. The market was dominated by legacy telecommunications infrastructure rather than API-based platforms.",
