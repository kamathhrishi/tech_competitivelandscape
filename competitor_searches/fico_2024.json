  "context": "In 2024, FICO maintained its dominant position with 90% market share in lending decisions and near-exclusive status in mortgage securitizations, but faced unprecedented challenges. In March 2024, Senator Josh Hawley urged the DOJ to investigate FICO for anti-competitive practices. FICO announced a new pricing model allowing mortgage lenders to bypass credit bureaus, which analysts estimated could hurt bureau earnings by 10-15%. VantageScore scored 33 million more consumers than FICO by incorporating rent and utility payments. The Federal Housing Finance Agency's mandate allowing VantageScore 4.0 for government-backed mortgages represented a significant crack in FICO's moat. AI-driven fintechs like Upstart and Zest AI continued to carve out niches in alternative credit assessment.",
