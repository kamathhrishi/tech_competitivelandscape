  "context": "According to Gartner's 2024 Edge & CDN Market Guide, 3.5 trillion daily requests are served by the world's largest CDNs, yet fewer than 38% of global websites have implemented advanced edge-security controls. Cloudflare faces stiff competition from AWS, Akamai, Fastly, Google, Microsoft, and Imperva. For CDN performance, competitors like Akamai, CloudFront, Fastly, and Bunny.net often outperform Cloudflare in specific regions on latency or price. The market is divided between enterprise-focused providers (Akamai, Imperva) and cloud-native options integrated with hyperscaler ecosystems (CloudFront, Azure CDN, Google Cloud CDN).",
