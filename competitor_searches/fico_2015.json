  "context": "By 2015, FICO remained the dominant player in credit scoring with 90% market share, but the competitive landscape was evolving. VantageScore 3.0 (released in 2013) had adopted FICO's 300-850 scale, making it easier for lenders to adopt. FICO's primary competitors were still the credit bureaus through VantageScore, but the company also faced increasing competition in its broader analytics and decision management software business from major enterprise software vendors. The predictive analytics market was becoming more crowded with specialized vendors offering alternatives to FICO's solutions.",
