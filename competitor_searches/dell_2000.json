  "context": "Dell surpassed Compaq to become the largest PC manufacturer in 1999 and became the global market leader in 2001. During the 2000 PC market slump, Dell initiated a price war that allowed it to gain market share while competitors struggled. The company had 13% global market share by 2001. Operating costs made up only 10% of Dell's revenue compared to 21% at HP, 25% at Gateway, and 46% at Cisco, giving Dell a significant competitive advantage.",
