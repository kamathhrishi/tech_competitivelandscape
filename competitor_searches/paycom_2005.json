  "context": "In 2005, Paycom was a small, regional online payroll provider founded in 1998 by Chad Richison in Oklahoma City. The company was in its early growth phase, seven years after Richison sold his house and used his 401(k) to fund the startup. Paycom differentiated itself as one of the first fully online payroll providers with a single-database architecture. The market was dominated by ADP and Paychex who together held nearly 20% market share and served 1.8 million clients through traditional service bureau and bolt-on acquisition models. Paycom was building toward its 2007 investment from Welsh Carson Anderson and Stowe.",
