The company focused on providing customer support solutions for small and medium-sized businesses with features like ticketing, knowledge base, and multi-channel support. By 2015, Freshworks had gained significant traction with its freemium model and was expanding its product portfolio beyond helpdesk into CRM and other customer engagement tools.
