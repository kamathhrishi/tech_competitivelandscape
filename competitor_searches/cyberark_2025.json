  "context": "CyberArk remains a privileged access management (PAM) leader, but 2025 PAM trends favor tools that offer agility, cost transparency, and extensibility. From operational complexity and high licensing fees to SaaS lock-in and rigid integrations, the drawbacks of CyberArk are driving organizations to look for competitors that offer secure access, just-in-time access, and granular access control without the overhead. The 2025 PAM market emphasizes automation, identity analytics, cloud-native deployment, and integration with broader zero trust architectures. Organizations increasingly seek solutions that balance comprehensive security with ease of deployment and use.",
