  "context": "By 2020, The Trade Desk had firmly established itself as the premier independent demand-side platform globally, having gone public in 2016 with revenue of $113.8 million that year. The company's position as the leading independent DSP was strengthened by its commitment to transparency and neutrality in contrast to 'walled gardens' that owned content. The programmatic advertising landscape was dominated by the competition between independent platforms like The Trade Desk and integrated ecosystems from Google, Amazon, and Facebook. Connected TV (CTV) and video advertising became increasingly important channels, with The Trade Desk expanding its capabilities across display, video, audio, and CTV. The industry saw consolidation with some competitors like MediaMath facing challenges while new specialized players emerged for specific advertising needs.",
