  "context": "In 2020, Toast was a privately-held restaurant technology company founded in 2011, focused on providing cloud-based POS and restaurant management systems built on Android. The company was rapidly growing in the fragmented restaurant POS market (800,000-900,000 US restaurant locations) with approximately 8% market penetration. Toast competed in a landscape of both general-purpose POS systems (like Square) and restaurant-specific solutions, differentiating itself through its integrated, all-in-one platform specifically designed for restaurants, 24/7 customer support, and Android-based hardware that offered more customization than iPad-based competitors.",
