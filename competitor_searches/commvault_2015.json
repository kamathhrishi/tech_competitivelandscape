The market generated revenue of almost $5.7 billion in constant currency but experienced slowing growth from 11.6% in 2014 to 5.5% in 2015. CommVault was the 4th largest vendor in the market, competing against established players like Veritas, EMC, and IBM, while also facing rising competition from Veeam, which was rapidly growing in the virtualization backup space.
