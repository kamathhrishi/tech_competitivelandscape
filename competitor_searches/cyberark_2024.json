  "context": "In 2024, CyberArk remains a dominant force in the Identity Security and Privileged Access Management market, continuing to set the standard for securing privileged accounts across hybrid and cloud environments. However, the company faces increasing competition from vendors offering alternatives that address concerns about CyberArk's operational complexity, high licensing fees, SaaS lock-in, and rigid integrations. The PAM market has expanded dramatically, valued at $4.57 billion in 2024 and projected to reach $20.94 billion by 2032 with a 20.94% CAGR. Organizations now seek solutions offering Just-In-Time (JIT) access, granular access control, Zero Trust architectures, and cloud-native designs without the overhead traditionally associated with comprehensive PAM platforms. The competitive landscape includes established enterprise vendors, specialized PAM providers, and emerging cloud-native security startups.",
