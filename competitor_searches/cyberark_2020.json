  "search_date": "2024-12-24",
  "context": "By 2020, CyberArk had cemented its position as a market leader in Privileged Access Management, protecting privileged accounts for more than 50% of Fortune 500 companies and commanding the largest market share of PAM customers. The PAM market was projected to reach $14.5 billion by 2027 with a 12.3% CAGR, driven by the critical statistic that 74% of breaches involved unauthorized access to privileged accounts. The market had evolved to encompass five distinct tool categories per Gartner: PASM, PEDM, secrets management, cloud infrastructure entitlement management (CIEM), and remote PAM. Competition intensified as cloud-native architectures emerged, organizations adopted hybrid environments, and vendors competed on deployment flexibility, licensing models, and Zero Trust security approaches.",
