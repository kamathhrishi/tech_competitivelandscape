  "context": "Veeva dominates ~80% of global life sciences CRM market serving over 1,500 customers with $2.6B revenue (fiscal 2025). Major 2025 development: Veeva announced in May 2024 it would not renew Salesforce agreement beyond Sept 2025, migrating CRM entirely to its own Vault CRM platform - creating transitional moment in market. Competition intensifying as Salesforce, IQVIA, and Oracle converge on life sciences cloud opportunity. Key competitive factors: AI/ML capabilities, pricing, industry-specific features, and integration with clinical systems.",

      "notes": "Major competitor following Veeva-Salesforce decoupling. New offering in phased roll-out (generally available 2024/2025). Just another Salesforce cloud offering that can be deployed globally. Most sophisticated AI platform which could leapfrog incumbents if applied well to pharma use cases"

    {
      "name": "IQVIA OCE (Orchestrated Customer Engagement)",
      "notes": "Approximately 400 OCE customers including many mid-to-large companies. Exceptional flexibility and scalability with Next Best Action (NBA) capabilities strategically guiding sales teams. Much more affordable: $3,000 for full platform access vs Veeva's $10-15,000/year certification costs. Arguably slightly ahead in embedding predictive intelligence at scale. Appeals to small and mid-sized companies"
