  "context": "In 2020, GitLab positioned itself as an all-in-one DevOps platform competing against Microsoft's GitHub (acquired 2018 for $7.5B). The pandemic accelerated DevOps adoption as remote development became standard. GitLab's integrated CI/CD was a key differentiator versus GitHub's GitHub Actions. The company was still private, preparing for its 2021 IPO. Competition focused on complete DevOps lifecycle versus best-of-breed tool combinations.",
