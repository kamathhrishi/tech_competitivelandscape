  "context": "In 2020, FICO maintained its 90% market share dominance among top U.S. lenders, with annual revenue of $1.29 billion. However, the competitive landscape was shifting with the emergence of AI-driven alternative credit scoring models. FICO continued to invest in artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities, having operationalized explainable and responsible AI for over 20 years in credit risk and fraud detection. New fintech competitors like Upstart and Zest AI were using machine learning to analyze thousands of data points and alternative data sources, challenging traditional credit scoring methodologies. VantageScore remained the primary direct competitor, while the broader analytics and decision management market featured established enterprise software vendors.",
