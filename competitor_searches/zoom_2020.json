  "context": "2020 was a pivotal year for Zoom as daily active users jumped from 10 million to over 200 million in just 3 months (March 2020), with daily meeting participants growing from 10 million in December 2019 to 300 million in April 2020, making it the fastest-growing software in the category. However, security issues emerged including 'Zoom bombing' attacks, leaked emails, and exposed webcam streams, leading major companies like Google, SpaceX, and NASA to ban Zoom use. This created opportunities for competitors, with Google Meet going free to all users in May 2020 specifically to compete with Zoom, and Microsoft Teams experiencing significant growth. The pandemic shifted the landscape from pre-pandemic dominance by Cisco, Polycom, and Avaya to rapid growth of cloud-based solutions.",
