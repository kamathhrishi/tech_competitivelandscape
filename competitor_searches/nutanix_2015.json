  "context": "In 2015, Nutanix was at the forefront of the hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI) revolution, having coined the term and pioneered the technology. Founded in 2009, Nutanix had successfully disrupted the traditional data center infrastructure market by combining compute, storage, and virtualization into a single, software-defined platform. By 2015, the company was preparing for its IPO (which occurred in 2016) and was the clear market leader in HCI. The competitive landscape in 2015 was evolving rapidly as traditional infrastructure vendors like VMware, EMC (Dell), and HPE recognized the HCI threat and were developing or acquiring competing solutions. Nutanix primarily targeted VMware customers initially, offering a more integrated and simpler alternative to traditional SAN/NAS storage architectures. The HCI market in 2015 was in a high-growth phase as enterprises began replacing legacy three-tier architectures.",
