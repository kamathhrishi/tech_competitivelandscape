  "context": "In 2000, PTC was a leading CAD vendor with Pro/ENGINEER competing against CATIA, Unigraphics, and I-DEAS in high-end 3D CAD. The company was transitioning from CAD to PLM with Windchill product lifecycle management. SOLIDWORKS (acquired by Dassault 1997) was growing in mid-market. The dot-com boom drove technology spending before the 2001 crash. PLM was emerging as distinct market from CAD.",
