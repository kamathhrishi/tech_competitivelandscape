  "context": "HubSpot's biggest competitors are Zoho CRM, Salesforce, and ActiveCampaign. Common frustrations driving customers to alternatives: steep pricing tiers (Starter $20/month, Pro features $890/month), added complexity slowing smaller teams, and feature limitations for ecommerce. Competition comes from full CRM platforms (Salesforce, Zoho), specialized marketing automation tools (ActiveCampaign, Brevo), and affordable alternatives for SMBs (EngageBay, Freshsales). Key competitive factors: pricing, ease of use, automation capabilities, and scalability.",
