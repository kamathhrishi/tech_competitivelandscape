  "context": "In 2015, ANSYS was the leading simulation software company. Siemens acquired CD-adapco (CFD simulation) for $970M, signaling market consolidation. Dassault SIMULIA and MSC Software were primary competitors in structural analysis. The market was evolving toward multiphysics simulation combining structural, thermal, CFD, and electromagnetic analysis. ANSYS differentiated with comprehensive physics coverage and workbench integration. Cloud simulation was emerging but not yet mainstream.",
