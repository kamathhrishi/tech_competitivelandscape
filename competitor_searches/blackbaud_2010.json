  "context": "By 2010, Blackbaud had further consolidated its dominance in the nonprofit software market through strategic acquisitions. The company acquired Kintera in 2008, expanding its online fundraising and event management capabilities. Blackbaud controlled approximately 25% of the nonprofit CRM market and was known as the clear market leader in social impact software. However, competition was increasing as general-purpose CRM vendors like Salesforce developed nonprofit-specific solutions, and new cloud-based fundraising platforms emerged. The market was evolving from traditional on-premise software toward cloud-based and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) delivery models.",
