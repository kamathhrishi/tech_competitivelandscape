  "context": "In 2005, Blackbaud was the established market leader in nonprofit fundraising and donor management software, having been founded in 1981 and relocated to South Carolina in 1989. The company's flagship product, The Raiser's Edge, dominated the nonprofit CRM market. In 1997, Blackbaud had acquired its chief competitor Master Software Inc., doubling its customer base and further strengthening its market position. The nonprofit software market in 2005 was less crowded than today, with Blackbaud controlling a significant market share. Most competitors were either smaller specialized vendors or larger CRM companies trying to adapt general-purpose software for nonprofit needs.",
