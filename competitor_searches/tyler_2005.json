  "context": "In 2005, Tyler Technologies was an established provider of software solutions for state and local governments. The company competed in a market dominated by large enterprise software vendors like Oracle (which acquired PeopleSoft in January 2005), SAP, and other ERP providers who offered government modules within broader platforms. Tyler differentiated itself through deep public sector specialization and domain expertise, owning multiple ERP products (Munis, Eden, and Incode) focused exclusively on government needs including financial management, courts and justice, property appraisal, and permitting. The Oracle-PeopleSoft merger consolidated the enterprise software market and strengthened large vendors' government offerings.",
