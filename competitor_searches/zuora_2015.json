  "context": "In 2015, Zuora was the recognized leader in subscription billing and revenue management software, having been founded in 2007 by former Salesforce executive Tien Tzuo. The company pioneered the concept of 'subscription economy' and built a comprehensive platform to help businesses transition from traditional one-time sales to recurring subscription models. By 2015, Zuora served over 1,000 customers across SaaS, media, telecommunications, and IoT industries. The subscription billing market in 2015 was still relatively specialized but growing rapidly as more companies adopted subscription and usage-based business models. Zuora positioned itself as the enterprise-grade solution for complex subscription scenarios, pricing models, and revenue recognition requirements. Competitors ranged from traditional billing systems to specialized subscription platforms, with varying capabilities for handling complex pricing, usage metering, and revenue recognition.",
