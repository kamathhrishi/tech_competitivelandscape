  "context": "As of 2025, GoDaddy continues to be a major player in domain registration and web hosting but faces fierce competition across all service areas. The website builder market is projected to have a 6.9% CAGR through 2032, reaching beyond $14.4 billion globally. GoDaddy is the world's fifth largest web host by market share with over 62 million registered domains. Key competitive differentiators have shifted to pricing transparency, included features (SSL, privacy protection, email, backups), and customer experience. Many competitors now include in their base plans what GoDaddy charges extra for. The market has also fragmented with specialized players dominating specific niches (Shopify for ecommerce, Squarespace for design-focused sites, WordPress.org for content management).",
