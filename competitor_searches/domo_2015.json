  "context": "In 2015, Domo was positioning itself as a cloud-first business intelligence platform aimed at making data accessible to business end users without heavy IT involvement. The BI market in 2015 was dominated by established players like Tableau and QlikView, with Microsoft having just launched Power BI earlier that year as a competitive response. Domo differentiated itself with its cloud-native architecture, mobile-first approach, and emphasis on real-time data visualization. The company was still private in 2015 (it would IPO in 2018) and competing against both traditional on-premise BI solutions and newer cloud-based analytics platforms. The market was undergoing a significant shift from traditional BI reporting tools to self-service analytics platforms that empowered business users.",
