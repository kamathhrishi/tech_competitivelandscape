  "context": "By 2024, the work management software market had matured significantly with increased competition from both specialized players and integrated platforms. Asana faced challenges from competitors offering more customization, AI features, and better pricing models. Common criticisms of Asana included limitations on multi-assignee tasks, lack of advanced resource management features (timesheets, workload charts), and siloed team structures. The market saw growing demand for platforms that could handle complex workflows, provide real-time cross-team visibility, and integrate AI-powered automation. Asana continued to compete on its clean interface and ease of use, but many organizations sought alternatives with more robust features for enterprise-scale project management.",
